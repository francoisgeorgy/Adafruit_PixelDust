  @brief  Particle simulation class for "LED sand."
          This handles the "physics engine" part of a sand/rain simulation.
          It does not actually render anything itself and needs to work in
          conjunction with a display library to handle graphics. The term
          "physics" is used loosely here...it's a relatively crude algorithm

          detection, etc.
